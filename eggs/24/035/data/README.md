DEAL selects non-redundant structures from atomistic trajectories via Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP), to be used to train machine-learning interatomic potentials.

It consists of two steps:
1. preselection using the MLP uncertainty (e.g. max uncertainty obtained with query-by-committee)
2. select a dataset of non-redundant configurations using the local predictive variance of a Gaussian Process

In addition, step 2. can be also used to perform subsampling of a trajectory even without the uncertainty pre-selection (see [examples](examples/README.md))

A short practical [introduction](DEAL.md) describes the main ingredients (SGP, local descriptors, uncertainty).

## Code highlights

* Select structures based on SGP predictive variance. 
* Analyze selected structures (e.g. along the trajectory or as a function of a CV)

##  Usage

DEAL can be run either with a command-line tool (`deal`) or using the python class (`DEAL`).

---


###  Minimal example

```bash
deal --file traj.xyz --threshold 0.1
```

or run in incremental mode by targeting a number of selected frames:

```bash
deal --file traj.xyz --max 50
```

DEAL will automatically:

* detect atomic species from the first frame
* use default GP/kernel/descriptor parameters
* use default output names


### 📄 With a YAML config file

For more customization you can create an `input.yaml` file (below are the default):

```bash
deal -c input.yaml
```

```yaml
data:
  files: ["traj.xyz"]     # can be a single file or a list of files
  #format: "extxyz"        # file format (e.g. extxyz, xyz, ...)
  #index: ":"              # frame selection [see ASE notation]
  #shuffle: false          # whether to shuffle the frames before processing 
  #seed: 42

deal:
  threshold: 0.1           standard mode: scalar or list of values
  # OR
  #max_selected: 50       # incremental mode: mutually exclusive with `threshold`
  #max_iterations: 10     # max iterations for incremental mode
  #threshold_factor: 0.75 # threshold_i = threshold_factor**(i+1)
  
  update_threshold: none # if not set it is chosen as 0.8 * threshold 
  max_atoms_added: 0.2    # limit the number of selected environments added per configuration (can be int (number of atoms) float (0,1) (fraction of total atoms), or -1 (no limit)
  #uncertainty_key: force_std_comp_max # optional per-atom array used for preselection
  #uncertainty_threshold: 0.05         # only atoms with uncertainty_key > this value can be selected/added
  #uncertainty_rejected_value: -1      # atomic_uncertainty value written for atoms below the preselection threshold
  #uncertainty_filter_initial_atoms: false # keep initial GP bootstrap unchanged by default
  #uncertainty_filter_update_atoms: true   # if false, external uncertainty gates frames but GP updates can use all GP-target atoms
  initial_atoms: none     # specify which atoms to use for GP initialization (list, fraction or number. Default: none, 1 atom per species)
  output_prefix: deal     # prefix for output files
  force_only: true
  train_hyps: false       # whether to re-train hyperparameters at each iteration (slower) 
  verbose: true           # allowed values: true/false/"debug" (default: true)
  save_gp: false
  save_full_trajectory: false  # if true, writes <prefix>_trajectory_uncertainty.xyz with per-atom array "atomic_uncertainty"

flare_calc:
  gp: SGP_Wrapper         # (see flare's documentation)
  kernels:
    - name: NormalizedDotProduct
      sigma: 2 
      power: 2
  descriptors:
    - name: B2
      nmax: 8
      lmax: 3
      cutoff_function: cosine
      radial_basis: chebyshev
  cutoff: 4.5
  
```
One can also use a base config file and override via CLI the options:
```bash
deal -c input.yaml -t 0.15
deal -c input.yaml --max-selected 50
```

### Python Usage

```python
# Import 
from deal import DataConfig, DEALConfig, FlareConfig, DEAL

# Define Config (uses defaults where not provided)
data_cfg = DataConfig(files="traj.xyz")
deal_cfg = DEALConfig(
    threshold=0.1,
    output_prefix="deal",    
)
flare_cfg = FlareConfig()

# Instantiate DEAL class
deal = DEAL(data_cfg, deal_cfg, flare_cfg)

# Run 
deal.run()

```

### Multiple thresholds

If the CLI receives a list of thresholds, DEAL will run once per threshold
(standard mode only).
```yaml
deal:
  threshold:
    - 0.10
    - 0.15
    - 0.20
```

Equivalent behaviour in Python:

```python
for thr in [0.10, 0.15, 0.20]:
    deal_cfg.threshold = thr
    deal_cfg.output_prefix = f"run_thr{thr}"
    DEAL(data_cfg, deal_cfg, flare_cfg).run()
```

### Incremental selection (CLI)

Use incremental mode when you want to select up to a target number of structures.

```yaml
deal:
  max_selected: 50
  max_iterations: 10
  threshold_factor: 0.75
```

At each iteration `i` (starting from 1), the threshold is decreased as:

`threshold_i = threshold_factor**i`

The run stops when one of these conditions is met: either selected structures reach `max_selected` or `max_iterations` is reached.

Note: `threshold` and `max_selected` are mutually exclusive in the CLI.

## Files

### Input files

As explained in the [introduction](DEAL.md), DEAL builds a model for energy and forces using a sparse Gaussian process, although this is used only as a proxy for uncertainty. For this reason, DEAL expects to receive a trajectory as input, for example stored in an .extxyz file, containing both energies and forces. However, since the predictive uncertainty does not depend on the labels, these do not need to be recalculated at the DFT level; in fact, they could be obtained by evaluating the trajectory with an ML potential. 

### Output files

In both cases the following file is generated (with the default `output_prefix=deal`):

1. **`deal_selected.xyz` – selected frames** 

Contains the atomic configurations where the GP uncertainty exceeded the threshold.
Includes atoms.info["original_frame"] indicating the original trajectory index.
If `save_gp: true`, DEAL also writes:
2. **`deal_flare.json` – final GP model**

If `save_full_trajectory: true`, DEAL also writes:
3. **`deal_trajectory_uncertainty.xyz` – full trajectory with uncertainties**

They both contain:
- per-atom array `atomic_uncertainty` (saved in `atoms.arrays`)
- frame scalar `max_atomic_uncertainty` (saved in `atoms.info`)

If `deal.uncertainty_key` and `deal.uncertainty_threshold` are set, DEAL first
reads the named per-atom uncertainty array from the input trajectory. After the
initial GP bootstrap, only atoms with values above `uncertainty_threshold` are
allowed to trigger selection. With the default
`uncertainty_filter_update_atoms: true`, the same mask is also applied to atoms
added to the GP. If this causes many one-atom updates, setting
`uncertainty_filter_update_atoms: false` keeps the external uncertainty as a
frame-selection gate while allowing selected frames to update the GP with all
SGP-target atoms; this is usually faster when GP updates dominate runtime. Atoms
below the external threshold are still written with `uncertainty_rejected_value`
in the output `atomic_uncertainty` array (default: `-1`). Frames with no atoms
above the external threshold are skipped, except when the first frame is needed
to initialize the GP. Set `uncertainty_filter_initial_atoms: true` to apply the
same filter also to the initial GP bootstrap atoms.

### Create a chemiscope file

After running `deal`, one can create a chemiscope visualization file with:

```bash
deal-chemiscope --prefix deal
```

or explicitly with the trajectory file and optionally also a COLVAR file:

```bash
deal-chemiscope --trajectory deal_selected.xyz --colvar COLVAR
```

`deal-chemiscope` creates a chemiscope visualization file from the selected structures.
The file includes all numeric properties available in `atoms.info` for each frame, and,
when `--colvar` is provided, it also includes the properties loaded from the COLVAR file.

This writes `deal_chemiscope.json.gz` (by default with `--prefix deal`).
It can be viewed online at https://chemiscope.org/ or inside Python:
```python
import chemiscope
chemiscope.show_input('deal_chemiscope.json.gz')
```
See also the Chemiscope [documentation](https://chemiscope.org/docs/).


## 🎛️ Choice of the parameters

Below a quick guide, see the [introduction](DEAL.md) to DEAL for a more in-depth explanation.

**Descriptors**

Local environments are characterized via the Atomic Cluster Expansion formalism as implemented in `flare`. Key hyperparameters: body order (`B1/B2`), radial degree `nmax`, angular degree `lmax`, and `cutoff` (in Å).

```yaml
  descriptors:
    - name: B2
      nmax: 8
      lmax: 3
      cutoff_function: cosine
      radial_basis: chebyshev
  cutoff: 4.5
```      

**Threshold**
```yaml
  threshold: 0.1
  update_threshold: 0.08  # if not set it is chosen as 0.8 * threshold      
  max_atoms_added: -1 # no limit on the number of selected environment of a given configuration to the GP.
  initial_atoms: 0.15 # use up to 15% of the atoms (of each species) for GP initialization
  # uncertainty_key: force_std_comp_max # optional per-atom uncertainty array for preselection
  # uncertainty_threshold: 0.05 # only atoms above this external uncertainty are considered
  # uncertainty_filter_initial_atoms: false # keep initial GP bootstrap unchanged
  # uncertainty_filter_update_atoms: true # set false to gate frames but update GP with all SGP-target atoms
```      

The`threshold` parameter in the DEAL configuration controls when a local environment is flagged by the SGP’s predictive variance (normalized by the noise hyperparameter). If any environment exceeds the threshold, the GP is updated and that environment (plus any others above `update_threshold`, up to `max_atoms_added`) is added. 

Some tips:

- The uncertainty values are unitless, and range between 0 and 1. Lower threshold means more selected structures; higher threshold, fewer selections. 
- A good starting point is around 0.1. As a rule of thumb, homogeneous, condensed and/or crystalline systems tend to have fewer different local environments and require smaller thresholds (<<0.1), whereas heterogeneous systems may require larger ones (>0.1). This is also connected with the number of species (more species -> higher treshold required).
- Try a few values and compare how many structures are selected; distributions often are very similar across thresholds, what changes is the number of structures. One can decide based on the computational budget (for DFT calculations).
- A practical strategy is to perform **incremental selection**: start with a high threshold, then decrease it progressively until a target number of structures is reached (see Example 4).
- Use chemiscope/OVITO to visualize the selected structures and identify which environments triggered selection. 

Note: the training time scales unfavorably with the number of samples. For a large dataset, it is advised to divide it in chuncks and run DEAL separately on each of them, and then performing a second DEAL selection on the output structures.
