# CpH-MetaD

## General Information

This page provides access to RNA parameters compatible with the stochastic titration Constant-pH Molecular Dynamics method and the metadynamics version (CpH-MetaD) using PLUMED v2.0 (see https://www.plumed.org/). The parametrization and metadynamics integration was developed in the Bussi Lab group by Tom√°s F.D. Silva (see: https://www.sissa.it/sbp/members.php?ID=472) and Prof. Giovanni Bussi (see: https://www.sissa.it/sbp/members.php?ID=323). 

The files in the folders are modified to allow compatibility of the st-CpHMD method with RNA and metadynamics. They should replace the already existing ones in the equally named folders in the source code of CpHMD-v3.0 (available on Nuno F.B. Oliveira's GitHub page: https://github.com/NunoFBOliveira/CpHMD_v3).

To perform reweight analysis, we recommend using the WHAM module available on the Bussi Lab GitHub: https://bussilab.github.io/doc-py-bussilab/bussilab/wham.html.
Notebooks and scripts will be available as protonation and conformation analysis templates.
