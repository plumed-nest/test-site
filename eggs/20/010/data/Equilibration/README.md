In these folder you can find the input and output files for the equilibration of liquid water and ice Ih.
Three different system sizes are considered: 16, 96, and 288 molecules.
These simulations are used to calculate the distributions of the kernel, the mean value of the order parameters, and to determine the equilibrium box size to perform the production runs.
