This repository contains the input files to reproduce the results of the paper mentioned above.
This is the ```light``` branch and the output files of the simulations are not included.
Please change to the ```master``` branch if you are looking for the results of the calculation.

Brief summary of the contents of each folder:
* ```Environments``` : This folder has the reference environments that will be used for the definition of the CV
* ```Equilibration``` : Input files for the equilibration of liquid water and ice Ih. Distributions of the kernel and equilibrium box sizes for production runs.
* ```BiasedSimulations``` : Input files for the biased simulations (production runs).
