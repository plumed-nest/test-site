Refining the RNA Force Field with Small-Angle X-ray Scattering of Helix–Junction–Helix RNA

This archive contains the input files needed to reproduce the free energy results of the paper.

In the FES folder the following files are available:
- md_prd.tpr is the GROMACS-format file for HB-CUFIX simulation (KCl).
- plumed.dat is the PLUMED input

The Mindist folder contains the files for Helix1(H1)-Helix2(H2) mindist analysis.

More information about our force field HB-CUFIX can be found at https://gitlab.com/KirmizialtinLab/hb_cufix

The simulations were performed with PLUMED 2.4, and GROMACS 2018.5.0.5
