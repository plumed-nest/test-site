# Angiotensin-1-7_Metadynamics
# Author: L. Am√©rica Chi

This simulations generates a Metadynamics simulation of Angiotensin-(1-7) vasoactive peptide in order to explor ist conformational landscape in solution at neutral pH. Colective variables are a kind of HBs and gyration radius.

# This script needs: md.tpr, index_metad2.ndx and metad.dat files in the rooth directory. 
# md.tpr should be created in its corresponding GROMACS version by using .itr, .top, .mdp and .pdb files
