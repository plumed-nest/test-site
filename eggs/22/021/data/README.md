# Phase diagram of the TIP4P/Ice water model by enhanced sampling simulations
## Sigbj√∏rn L. Bore, Pablo M. Piaggi, Roberto Car, and Francesco Paesani

This repository contains the input files, the raw data, and associated analysis scripts needed to compute the phase diagram of TIP4P/Ice by enhanced sampling simulations.

Brief summary of the contents of each folder:

* ```GibbsDuhemSimulations``` : Preparation and execution of Gibbs-Duhem simulations for determination of coexistence lines.
* ```ReferenceData```: Reference data files for published phase diagrams and coexistence lines.
* ```IceIh_Liquid``` : Preparation, execution and analysis of biased ice Ih liquid coexistence simulations.
* ```IceII_Liquid``` : Preparation, execution and analysis of biased ice II liquid coexistence simulations.
* ```IceIII_Liquid``` : Preparation, execution and analysis of biased ice III liquid coexistence simulations.
* ```IceV_Liquid``` : Preparation, execution and analysis of biased ice V liquid coexistence simulations.
* ```IceVI_Liquid``` : Preparation, execution and analysis of biased ice VI liquid coexistence simulations.
