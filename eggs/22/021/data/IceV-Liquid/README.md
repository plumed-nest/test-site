# Melting point for IceV-Liquid coexistence

* ```1-Bulk```: Simulation of bulk liquid and bulk ice V. Used to determine parameters for environment similiarity index. 
* ```2-CalculateDistributions```: Calculation, and choice for parameters for envioronment similarity index and collective variable number of ice-like molecules. 
* ```3-PrepareCoexistenceConfiguration```: Sets up correct initial box for coexistence simulations. Uses bulk simulations to determine average interface area. 
* ```4-BiasedCoexistence```: Biased coexistence simulations and analsysis script for determining melting points.
