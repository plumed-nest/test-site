This folder contains the scripts to calculate the analytic PES for the 2D 3D and 6D used in the paper.

Info on the process can be found in the launch\_calculation.sh file in earch folder.
The execution requires the compilation of the two c++ programs contained in 
1. grid_to_xyz/ 
2. integrate_probability/

be aware that in the 3D and 6D cases, the execution will require a large amount of time, RAM and physical memory.
