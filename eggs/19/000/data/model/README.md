**ERRATA CORRIGE:**

In the [Supporting Information](https://ndownloader.figstatic.com/files/14598878) we refer to this model as the Wolfe-Quapp potential, eq. S10.
This is not correct, the actual potential used is a slightly modified version of the Wolfe-Quapp one. 
The correct version of eq. S10 is the following:

`U(x,y) = 2*(x^4 + y^4 - 2*x^2 - 4*y^2 + 2*x*y + 0.8*x + 0.1*y + 9.28)`

Notice that eq. S12 is correct as it is in the paper.
